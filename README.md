# OCI_to_Azure_Automation
Terraform and Ansible Scripts to automate the provisioning and setup of OCI and Azure Virtual Private Connections.

## Prerequirements
Clone the Github Repo, then go to https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html and download the Instant Client .zip. I personally used instantclient-basic-linux.x64-19.6.0.0.0dbru.zip. After this step is done rename the file to instantclient.zip and place it inside the cloned directory.
